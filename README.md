**Project Motivation:** The current landscape of maternal health data is characterized by fragmentation across diverse sources, posing challenges in accessing and analyzing information efficiently. The difficulties in retrieving specific maternal health data promptly lead to delays in critical information access. Additionally, the complexity of analyzing trends, patterns, and correlations without a structured approach impedes the extraction of valuable insights. Timely intervention is crucial for effective monitoring, but delayed access to information hampers the responsiveness and efficiency of monitoring maternal health.

**Project Objective:** Addressing the challenges posed by fragmented data, inefficient retrieval, complex analysis, and delayed monitoring, the project aims to create a centralized maternal health database. This initiative seeks to streamline data storage, enhance retrieval efficiency, facilitate systematic analysis, and contribute to more responsive and informed decision-making in maternal healthcare.

**Project M.O:** The data procedure involved interfacing with the GHO portal to extract relevant maternal health data using the WHO API. Subsequent transformations were applied to enhance data
accuracy, including the discarding of unnecessary columns and adjustments for missing values. Proper indexing for the fact table was established to facilitate efficient data
integration and correlation. The processed data was then loaded into the ElephantSQL database, ensuring a structured and accessible storage environment. Finally, for insightful
analysis and interpretation, the data was loaded into Tableau to create comprehensive visualizations, offering a nuanced view of maternal health trends and patterns. 
This streamlined procedure aims to contribute to the project's overarching objective of creating a centralized maternal health database for more responsive and informed 
decision-making in maternal healthcare.
